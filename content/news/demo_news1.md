This is a demo news item about portal launch.

The Pathogen Data Network just received the Notice of Award from the NIH NIAID Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRC) for Infectious Diseases Programs. The project is planned over 4 years. We are very grateful to NIH for their support, and to all the consortium members for their commitment and excellent inputs and discussions throughout the proposal phase. Looking forward to getting the work started in September!
