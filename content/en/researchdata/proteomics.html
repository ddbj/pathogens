                            <P>
Protein Data Bank Japan (PDBj) cooperates with the U.S. Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB), Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB) and The Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe), and operates a three-dimensional structure database for biopolymers such as proteins, nucleic acids and sugars as an international PDB archive. It also provides various derived databases and their analysis tools. The special page provides structural information on the new coronavirus in Chinese and Korean as well as Japanese.</P>

                            <P>

UniProt is a leading database containing amino acid sequences and their functional data. It consists of three different databases: "UniProtKB", "UniRef" and "UniParc". On the special page, the data on amino acid sequence related to COVID-19 is published in a different cycle from UniProt itself.</P>

                            <P>

TogoProt is an integrated search system for protein-related databases provided by the National Bioscience Database Center (NBDC). In the keyword search, it first shows a list of protein family names in the menu. When you select your desired protein or family from the menu, the protein (family) data and the link will be displayed and then you can get to the desired entry in a database. The link above is the search results for "SARS-CoV-2".</P>

jPOST is an integrated database for proteome that standardises, integrates and centrally manages various proteome data scattered within and outside Japan. It covers data such as post-translational modifications and absolute expression levels of various species. The linked page provides re-analysed data of the proteome related to COVID-19. </P>
