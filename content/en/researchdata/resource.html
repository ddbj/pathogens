RIKEN BioResource Research Center (BRC) is a unique repository in the world, as it collects and distributes bioresources of three different levels, i.e., genetic materials (genomic and cDNA clones) and cell lines of human and animal origins as well mouse strains. The research and developments on COVID-19 have been focusing on the following four subjects: 1) SARS-CoV-2 infection and proliferation, 2) Pathogenesis and host defense, 3) Disease progression to clinically severe cases and 4) Development of effective therapies of COVID-19 patients and preventive vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The RIKEN BRC provides the lists of mouse strains useful for the COVID-19 R&D.</P>
