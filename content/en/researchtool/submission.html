                            <P>
DDBJ works in close relation to its European and American counterparts (EBI and NCBI), and it is one of the three major international data banks that builds the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank International Nucleotide Sequence Database. Through the submission navigation, it allows you to submit nucleotide sequences and output data from next-generation sequencers, research projects, biological samples, human data with restricted access, etc.</P>
