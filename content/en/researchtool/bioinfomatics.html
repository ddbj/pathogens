KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is an integrated page for the KEGG database system. It allows you to access by data types (PATHWAY, BRITE, DISEASE, DRUG, GENES, GENOME, COMPOUND, GLYCAN, REACTION) and by organisms. It also allows you to access the execution screens of various analysis tools such as KEGG Mapper, KEGG Atlas, KASS, etc.</P>
