KEGG DISEASE: Diseases viewed as perturbed states of the molecular system
KEGG DISEASE is a database that collects data on diseases with known genetic factors (single gene disorder and multifactorial disease) and infectious diseases with known pathogen genome in a form that can be calculated. Each disease entry is identified by an accession number, called the "H" number, and is represented by a list of related pathways and pathogenic genes and that of environmental factors, diagnostic markers and molecules of such as therapeutic agents. The link above displays the entries for "COVID-19".&lt;/P>
